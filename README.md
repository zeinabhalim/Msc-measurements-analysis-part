Project description:


Aiming to investigate the phase transition from hadronic to Quark-Gluon Plasma state (QGP) by relating the change in the macroscopic variables, such as transverse momentum and multiplicity distribution, to the microscopic hypothesis of the transition mechanism.I analyzed the properties of the produced charged particles through different proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions that are Fitted by the Tsallis distribution
function, in the following reactions:

Proton-Proton collisions:

1- Transverse momentum spectra of produced charged hadrons through inelastic pp interactions at the center of mass energies per nucleon pair
=6.3,7.7,8.8, 12.3, and 17.3 GeV at rapidity ranges y from 0.0 to 2.0.

2- The transverse momentum distributions of the produced charged hadrons through proton-proton collision at different energies = 0.9, 2.36, 7 TeV at mid-rapidity range.

Nucluse-nucluse collisions:

1-The experimental measurements of different secondary charged particles emitted in inelastic collisions, e.g., Pseudorapidity distribution of the shower particles emitted in 4.5 AGeV/c 28-Si interactions with emulsion.

2- The transverse momentum distributions of the produced charged hadrons through different A-A collisions at different energies in the GeV
and TeV region at mid-rapidity range.

*The analysis process was performed in MATHMETICA wolfram software, so the project included the Mathematica file and its corresponding PDF file.
