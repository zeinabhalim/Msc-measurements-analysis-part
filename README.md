Project desecribtion:

Part of my master's research, si-28 emulsion data

It is experimental measurements of different secondary charged particles emitted in inelastic collisions of silicon nuclei with the nuclei of nuclear emulsion at the momentum of 4.5 A GeV/c. 
Aiming to investigate the phase transition from hadronic to Quark-Gluon Plasma state (QGP) by relating the change in the macroscopic variables such as transverse momentum, multiplicity distribution to the microscopic hypothesis of the transition mechanism.
